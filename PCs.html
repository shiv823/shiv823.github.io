<center><h1>Semester Project ‚≠ê</h1></center>
<center><p style="color: dark-grey; padding: 0px 70px; border: 1px solid white";> Throughout the semester, my partner Nick and I worked on a social good computing project together with the intention of building more trust between donors and tree charities. We wanted to increase the number of donations tree charities receive and figured the best way to approach this was to allow users to see their monetary impact. The project had multiple components (9 total to be precise), each broken down this semester weekly. </p></center>

<hr>

<center><h1>Components 0-1 ‚ùó</h1></center>
<center><p style="color: dark-grey; padding: 0px 70px; border: 1px solid white";>Both component 0 and 1 can be described as a pre-project planning task. At this point, everyone in the class was thinking of personal ideas that would promote social good across a variety of topics. The ideas were then shared with classmates and teams formed based on interests and skills. Nick is the mastermind behind the TreeTracker project. I enjoyed listening to his presentation and we decided to work together! Here is the original padlet board of ideas where you can find Nick's project pitch: <a href="url">https://padlet.com/tug81053/eowih0g78662cs4b</a>. We planned to create an application that promotes trust in charities thus boosting tree planting as a result.
In terms of Rediet Abebe‚Äôs roles of computing for social justice, this project would best be understood as a synecdoche. Planting more trees and reducing tree cutting has been a social good topic for a long time, however utilizing technology with a focus on charity trust is a newer and more innovative approach.

<center><h1>Component 2: Draft Proposal ‚úèÔ∏è</h1></center>
<center><p style="color: dark-grey; padding: 0px 70px; border: 1px solid white";>Early in the project, we wanted to show users where their money went by showing the location of where their specific tree got planted, along with what type of tree. We wanted it to be personable and relatable for our users so that they would want to donate more. For many people, seeing is believing. Seeing 'their' tree allows our users to feel connected with the charity. Additionally, we decided on the tools below to achieve our project: </p></center>

<center><h1>Component 3: Group Proposal üë•</h1></center>
<center><p style="color: dark-grey; padding: 0px 70px; border: 1px solid white";>In project component 3, we expanded upon component 2. To summarize this part, we concluded has two important implementations: 1) figuring out how to web scrape data, and 2) creating a UI that is simple for the user to understand. Some milestones we decided on include: figuring out common tree planting charities, figuring out what libraries are needed for web scraping and creating a user interface, figuring out what user input will be needed, and then actually creating the application itself. We chose to forgo assigning each other roles and wanted to play on our strengths. Additionally, we didn't want to follow a strict timeline either as we weren't sure how long implementing the two tasks would take. ***This component is slightly irrelevant now as we actually ended up changing our tool stack completely later on and made adjustments to our original idea.</p></center>

<center><h1>Component 4: Project Design Specification and Evaluation üîé</h1></center>
<center><p style="color: dark-grey; padding: 0px 70px; border: 1px solid white";>This component was a multi-week step, as it involved drafting our design specifications and evaluations before polishing the details. Essentially, we broke our project down into multiple 'layers'. Layer 1 is what would be our minimum achievements, while layer 4 is our goal if we're aiming real high. Realistically, we're hoping to land somewhere between layers 2 and 3. Down below are images of layers, as well as the PDF of both the draft and final submission.</p></center>

<center><h1>Component 5: Intermediate Prototype Presentation üó£</h1></center>
<center><p style="color: dark-grey; padding: 0px 70px; border: 1px solid white";>In this component, teams presented their intermediate project prototype. I was not in class for the presentation unfortunately, but Nick presented on our team's behalf and discussed component 4 in front of the class. Nick wrote for his slide: Our project was going to be a tree planting tracker where whenever you donate to a nonprofit tree planting company, such as the Arbor Day Foundation it tells you where and what kind of trees were planted with your money. The goal was to create a platform where the user can enter any website they want, and the system will determine whether or not it‚Äôs a tree planting organization. The system will then tell the user what kind of trees were planted with their donation, and where they were planted.</p></center>

<center><h1>Component 6: Our Updated Prototype + Project Presentation ‚öôÔ∏è </h1></center>
<center><p style="color: dark-grey; padding: 0px 70px; border: 1px solid white";>Component 6 is where we shifted gears and our idea was 100% solidified. It became clear that finding actual tree location data from charities was going to become a challenge. Instead of finding where individual trees got planted, we decided to show a general map of the impact every donation has. This was done using Global Forest Watch‚Äôs interactive forest map, which is a free online tool that shows tree losses and gains. Additionally, we switched over to Swift as our language of choice instead of Python, as almost 80% of the world uses a smartphone in 2022. Mobile donations have also risen by <b>205%</b> in the last year alone. It was here that I decided it made sense to focus on charity trust, as tree planting increase would be a byproduct. I did research and learned that only 19% of American adults trust charities. I wanted to raise this number by showing the app's users that there are actually trees being planted, hence producing more donations and users.</p></center>
<center><p style="color: dark-grey; padding: 0px 70px; border: 1px solid white";>For our final project implementation, we used Swift and Xcode to create an iOS application with a clean and user-friendly interface. We broke this part into 3 different steps: 1) Design the app‚Äôs UX using tools such as Swift, Adobe XD, and InVision. 2) Using Xcode, add in screens and use Swift for user data. and 3) Test and see if our app works</p></center>
<center><p style="color: dark-grey; padding: 0px 70px; border: 1px solid white";>We contemplated adding a leaderboard system, as we learned while doing research that Gen Z (individuals born between 1997 and 2007) donates the most to charities. 87% of Gen Z plays video games too, so we thought making the app competitive would be fun for them.</p></center>
<center><p style="color: dark-grey; padding: 0px 70px; border: 1px solid white";>I first approached the app by designing wireframes using pencil and paper. It's not very beautiful to look at, but it wasn't meant to be. I wanted to understand the general flow of the app before I began designing it.</p></center>

<center><a><img src="/users/Icey/Desktop/Screen Shot 2022-05-04 at 2.24.16 AM.png" style="width:633px; height:249px;"</a></center>

<center><p style="color: dark-grey; padding: 0px 70px; border: 1px solid white";>Next, I designed the actual mockup in a free tool called Adobe XD. I've used Adobe XD while taking courses in the Tyler School of Art, so I already had some familiarity with it. I added visuals to the wireframe and confirmed the design. Shown below is one of my mockups:</p></center>

<center><a><img src="/users/Icey/Desktop/Screen Shot 2022-05-03 at 3.49.21 AM.png" style="width:294px; height:528px;"</a></center>

<center><p style="color: dark-grey; padding: 0px 70px; border: 1px solid white";>Finally, after I knew visually what I wanted to achieve, I opened up the Xcode IDE and made my attempt at Swift by following various online tutorials. I used Xcode a few years ago, however it had been so long that I forgot almost everything. Luckily, it came back to me relatively fast! Down below are various pictures that show my work. In <b>component 7</b>, there is a <b>video demonstration</b> of my application.</p></center>

<center><a><img src="/users/Icey/Desktop/Screen Shot 2022-05-04 at 2.37.36 AM.png" style="width:757px; height:427px;"</a></center>

<center><p style="color: dark-grey; padding: 0px 70px; border: 1px solid white";>As Swift was relatively new for me, I relied heavily on online resources to get my app up and running. It's not a perfect app, but with the time period, I think I was able to learn a lot, such as: Xcode storyboards, code to connect URLs to buttons, how to create a launch page, app transitions, connecting a data map, allowing users to enter information on the app, and navigating through the IDE.</p></center>
<center><p style="color: dark-grey; padding: 0px 70px; border: 1px solid white";>Some things I was not able to implement: mail authentication, cross-platform ability, retaining user information on an account to implement a leaderboard system (not enough Swift experience and time), maybe a chat system to talk with other users? If possible, it would be nice to contact charities for data to implement our original tree tracking idea as a feature in this app.

<center><h1>Component 7: Video and Website üíª</h1></center>
<center><p style="color: dark-grey; padding: 0px 70px; border: 1px solid white";>In this component, we created a video and this website! Below you can watch our app demonstration: (Unfortunately I wasn't able to do a screen recording on my laptop with a voiceover simultaneously. I attached the audio file below and it matches the video 25 seconds in.) </p></center>

<center><h1>Component 8: Final Submission üéâ</h1></center>
<center><p style="color: dark-grey; padding: 0px 70px; border: 1px solid white";>Finally, we ended the semester with our personal contribution write-ups. Overall, we both learned a lot about iOS app development, as well as the limitations of Python. We also were able to gain experience working on a semester-long team project and gained valuable communication skills. Additionally, coding this website in HTML and CSS was new for me as well, as I've never built my own. ***All citations can be found in the Google Slides linked in component 6.</p></center>
